# R

R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.

# RStudio 

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. 

# R Markdown

R Markdown provides an authoring framework for data science. You can use a single R Markdown file to both 

  - save and execute code 
  - generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience

R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of static and dynamic output formats. R Markdown has the following features:

- Fully reproducible reports
- Simple markdown syntax for text
- Code goes in chunks

Tip: Keep the Markdown cheat sheet handy, weâ€™ll refer to it often as the course progresses.
